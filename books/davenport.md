# Keeping Up with the Quants: Your Guide to Understanding and Using Analytics, by Thomas Davenport and Jinho Kim

When using big data to make big decisions, non-quants should focus on the first and the last steps of the process. The numbers people typically handle the details in the middle, but wise non-quants ask lots of questions along the way.

Analytics-based decision making in six steps: 
* Recognize the problem or question: Frame the decision or business problem, and identify possible alternatives to the framing.
* Review previous findings: Identify people who have tried to solve this problem or similar ones—and the approaches they used.
* Model the solution and select the variables: Formulate a detailed hypothesis about how particular variables affect the outcome.
* Collect the data: Gather primary and secondary data on the hypothesized variables.
* Analyse the data: Run a statistical model, assess its appropriateness for the data, and repeat the process until a good fit is found.
* Present and act on the results: Use the data to tell a story to decision makers and stakeholders so that they will take action.
