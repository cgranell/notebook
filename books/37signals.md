## Rework
Tis is more a business  book than a technical book. It gieves short recipes to enhance one's way of working and to thinking in practical and pragmatic terms. Some remarkable sentences: 
* Clear writing leads to clear thinking
* Stories, mockups are just approximations. Running software is real.
* Real things lead to real reactions.

## Get real
It contains a list of hints / recipes for success organized in categories for creating web applications / services. Rather than a technical book, the authors focus on short pieces of advice, some of them are quite obvious and make perfect sense at firt glance, but most developers actually fail to get them into their app development process. One learns to focus on the essentials first to get work done. A must-read book together with the rework book.

Go from branstorms to sketches to HTML to codinfg to get something real up and running:
* **Brainstorm**. Come up with ideas. Write a one page story in plain language about what the app needs to do.
* **Design the interface before you start programming**. The interface is your product, what people see is what you are selling. Draw stuff. Paper sketches. 
    * Epicenter desing: start from the core of the page and build outward. Essentials first, extras second. This means you design the most important piece of content first, because a page cannot live without its epicenter (the purpose of the page)
* **Create HTML screens and mock-ups**. Confusion disappears when everyone starts using the same screens. For each screen, you need to consider three possible states: regular, blank, and error. 
    * Regular state is what people see when everything's working fine adn ypur app is flush with data; 
    * Blank state is what people see when using the app for the first time, before data is entered. First impressions are crucial. If you fail to design a thoughtful blank state, you'll create a negative impression of your app; and 
    * Error state is what people see when something goes wrong. Defensive design for the Web.
* **Code it**.Whrn the moock-up looks good, go ahead and plug in the programming code. But remember: keep your code as simple and possible.
