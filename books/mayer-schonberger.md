# Big Data: A revolution that will transform how we life, work and think, by Viktor Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger and Kenneth Cukier

Big Data is about 3 shifts of mindset: 
* Analyse vast amount of data. Instead of using the shortcut of random sample, "Big" is relative to the comprehensive set of data (N=all). Now it si possible because we are in the datafication era: taking information about all things under the sun. 
* Messiness of data instead of exactitude. Impression or messiness may be a positive feature. For example, messiness may refer to combine different types of information from different sources, or it may refer to the inconsistency of formatting. Greater messiness, greater scale. 
* Correlation instead of causality. Knowing what, not why, is good enough. Correlation means non-causal analysis. This goes to data-driven approach versus hypothesis-driven approach (pg 71)

Key points: 
* More data trumps better algorithms --> More data and simpler models trumps less data and complex models
* When location become data (pg 86)
* When interactions become data" (pg 91
* Not a primary use alone, but several, novel uses of data (pg 104)
* What counts is scale in data (pg 146)
