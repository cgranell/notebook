# Talk like TED, by Carmine Gallo

The 9 Public-Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds:
* Secret #1: Passion leads to mastery and your presentation is nothing without it. Dig deep to identify your unique and meaningful connection to your presentation. "What makes your heart sing?. Be passionate about your topic. The first step to inspiring others is to make sure you are inspired yourself.
* Secret #2: Tell stories to reach people´s hearts and minds. "Stories are just data with a soul". Stories illustrate, illuminate and inspire.
    * Ethos (credibility), 
    * Logos (evidence, data), 
    * Pathos (emotional appeal)
* Secret #3: Deliver the presentation as comfortably as having a conversation with a close friend. Be natural, speak in a conversational tone, and rehearse, rehearse, and rehearse.
* Secret #4: Reveal information that´s completely new to your audience, packed differently, or offers a fresh and novel way to solve an old problem. Explain your big idea in 140 characters or less. This helps your audience recall the one big idea your´re trying to teach them. "What is the one thing I want my audience to know"
* Secret #5: The jaw-dropping moment is a presentation is when the presenter delivers a shocking, impressive or surprising moment. Does your presentation need a prop? Package statistics in the best, most memorable way. Ending on a high note
* Secret #6: Give your audience something to smile about: Anecdotes, observations and personal stories; Analogies and metaphors; Quotes; Video; Photos
* Secret #7: Stick to the 18-minute rule. Create a message map: 
    * Create a Twitter-friendly headline, 
    * Support the headlines with three key messages, 
    * Reinforce the three messages with stories, statistics, examples
* Secret #8: Paint a mental picture with multisensorial experiences. Use visuals to enhance words, not duplicate. Add images or background pictures to pie charts, tables and graphs. No more than 40 words in the first 10 slides. Kill bullet points on most of your slides. The way to deliver data: one statistic (or theme) per slide, followed by images to give the brain a rest.
* Secret #9: Be authentic, open and transparent. If you try to be something or someone you are not, you´ll fail to gain the trust of your audience. Practice, practice, and practice so that the mechanics of giving your presentation do not monopolize your attention and focus.

Final notes: you need examples, techniques, passion, and practice. You need also courage, the courage to follow your passion, articulate your idea simply, and express what makes your heart sing.
