# Books notes

This is a partial list of my book summaries chronologically ordered by when I read them. In recent summaries I start by explaining the book in three sentences, then pots a list of key ideas, sentences and lessons from the book.

## Deep work
*Deep Work, by Cal Newport*

### The book in three sentences
* **Deep Work**: Activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
* **Shallow Work**: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often perfeormed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value ans are easy to replicate. 
* Deep work makes you better at whay you do, lets you acchieve more in less time, and provides the sense of true fulfilment that comes from the mastery of a skill (craftmanship).

### Summary
* Core abilities to perform deep work are 1/ to quickly master hard things, and 2/ to produce at an elite level, in terms of quality and speed. Sumarising, high-quality work produced = (time spent) x (intensity of focus). 
* Deep work builds on values like quality, craftmanship and mastery, and it is well suited to generate a [flow state](#fluir).
* Rule #1 **Work deeply**. How to reduce the confict of working deeply in a shallow world? 
  * Strategies for integrating deep work into your workday in order to manage your limited wildpower: 1/ monastic (always in depth), 2/ Bimodal (tow long periods between depth and shallowness), 3/ rhythmic (rock-solid routines to get bits done on a regular basis), 4/ journalistic (any gap anytime without previous schedule).
  * Build rituals to start deep work sessions and also to end workday (see "be lazy").
  * Grand gesture: by doing a radical change to your normal environment, you increase the perceived importance of the deep work task. 
  * Collaborative deep work: hub-and-spoke model to balance and optimise separatedly serendipituos encounters and deep work efforts.
  * I know the *what* but not the *how*: 1/ focus on the wildly important (a small number of ambitious goals), 2/ act on lead measures (time spent in deep work dedicated to the above goals), 3/ keep a compelling scoreboard (register deep work hours), 4/ create a cadence of accountability (weekly review scoreboard). 
  * Be lazy: idleness is necessary to getting any work done, by maintaining a strict endpoint to your workday. Regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. Shutdown ritual during last quarter of work day and end with "shutdowm complete". 
* Rule #2 Embrace boredom.
* Rule #3 Quit social media.
* Rule #4 Drain the shallows.


## Space and place
*Space and place: The perspective of experience, by Yi-Fu Tuan*

### The book in three sentences
* Human beings require both space and place. Open space has no fixed pattern of established human meaning. Mythical space is an intellectual construct, it is a response of feeling adn imagination to fundamental human needs.  
* When space feels familiar to us, it becomes places. Indeed, place can be defined in a variety of ways: place is whatever stable object catches out attention. Or place is an organised world of meaning, too
* The built environment clarifies social roles and relations. Like language, the built environment has the power to define and refine sensibility. Architectural space continues to articulate social order. Modern built environment even maintains a teaching function. Architecture continues to exert a direct impact on the senses and feelings
*  Spatial ability precedes spatial knowledge. Intimate experiences are difficult to make public. 
*  How time and place are related is an intrincate problem that invites different approaches: time as motion or flow and place as a pause in the temporal current; attachment to place as a function of time, as in "it takes time to know a place"; adn place as time made visibe, or place as memorial to times past.


## Research in the wild
*Research in the wild, by Yvonne Rogers and Paul Marshall*

### The book in three sentences
* Research in the wild is about **theorising about people's everyday use and interaction with technology and their environment**.
*  Generic Framework made up of technology, desing, *in situ* studies, and theory, to conducting innovative research in the wild. 
*  Through three real-word case studies, the framework is operationalised, and practical challenges, obstacles adn ethcial issues discussed
  
### Summary
* First two chapters set the context, going from "cognition in the wild" to "research in the wild". The authors stated that this transation is needed to "rethink theory more broadly, both at macro and micro level of analyses, to account for how people are using, relying on, and appropiating the diversity of technologies that have become suffused in their lives." (pg 17-18). 
* Chapter 3 overviews approaches to conducting research in the wild, in which  the focus is on how to engage a community so they can participate in the project and be able to see the value of the technology intervention.
* Typically, research in the wild uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, to glean subjective, aggregate findings over time and space over groups of people. A challenge in designing technology in the wild is how to design it to be noticeable, approachable and obvious what to do
* Chapter 4 reports three in-depth studies to illustrate how different methods and approaches work together. These studies are framed according to the conceptual framework.
* Last chapter (5) discusses the extra work that's needed behind the scenes to conducting research in the wild, and how to deal with unforeseen challenges, obstacles and uncertainties. 

## Code and The City
*Code and The City, edited by Rob Kitchin and Sung-Yueh Perng*

### The book in three sentences
* The book is the result of a 2014 workshop held in Ireland in the concet of the ERC Advance Grant "The Programmable City"
* The underlying idea is to explore the relationship between code and urban space, leading to the concept of code/space, wherein code is essential to a space being produced as intended, as happens in much of the city space that is produce as code/space. 
* Chapters are gouoped into three sections: (i) *Code, codings , infrastructure and cities* considers the realtionship between code and the cty in a broad sende; (ii) *Locative social media and mobile computing* considers the relatioship betwwen code, locative media and mobile computing, focusing on how smartphones are mediating how people interact with the city and each other; and (iii) *Governance, politics and knowledge* examines the urban politics of code.

### Summary
Chapters can be read individually. I commented here some of them, especially relevent for my interests. While Chapter 1 is the introduction to the whole book, chapter 2 is a relevant reading to realise of the importance of exploring the relationship between code, urban space and citizens. Its line of argumentatio is scientifically sound going from simple to more complex and realistic conceptual framework for programmable urbanism. CHapter 3 *The Internet of Urban Things* gives a good overvie of IoT adn Web of thing, paying attention to the temporal dynamics of things. Chapter 4 *Interfacing urban intelligence* calls for rethinking what type of "urban interfaces" we want.

Chapter 8 *Feeling the place* refers to the concepts of space/place and attachement of place (Manuel's thesis). Chapter 10 provides a theoretical model and multilayyered approach to mobile computing, focusin in particular on (location-based) moving applications. Chapter 11 presents a selfie exploratory visualisation tool which can be relevent of our own (spatial visualisation) projects. And Chapter 16 gives a gentle introduction to the geodemograhic field   
## Mobile Sensors Context Aware Computing
*Mobile Sensors and Context-aware Computing, by Manish J Gajjar*

### The book in three sentences
* Good introduction to background concepts such as context, context computign adn locatin based services
* Practical guide to physical sensors, virtual sensors, and sensors hub (sensor fusion) in mobile computing
* Cover many aspects (without excesive detail) when working on a context-aware mobile computing solution that involves hardware-software

### Summary
Depending on the level of details required, some parts of the book can be skipped (how physical sensors operate, etc.). Chapter 2 (Context-aware Computing) gives a short but consice introduction to basic concepts in mobile and context-aware computing. Chapter 6 (Software, firmwar and drivers) explains the Android Sensor Software Stack, worth a reading especially for programmers of mobile apps. Chapter 10 (Usability) shows a figure (10.3, pg 273) summarising the four key experiences based on context interactions: Know me, Free me, Link me, Express me. Next , it provides a short discussion on sensor-based user interaction (pg 282), and a series of tables summaring sensor usages in use cases (pg 292-296). Finally, Chapter 11 (Sensor Application Areas) covers a variety of application examples where sensor-based and context-aware computing can make a splash. Worth a reading the section about Augmented Reality (pg. 206 onwards). There, it differs between real-time context and passive/stored context when applying Augmented Reality context-aware systems to gaming, education and location-based services and applications.  

## R for spatial analysis
*An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping, by Chris Brunsdon and Lex Comber*

### The book in three sentences

### Summary

## Here comes everybody
*Here comes everybody, by Clay Shirky*

p109 personal motivation meets collaborative production
p112 flexibility of role is a commom result of mass amateurization
p117 Spontaneous, unmanaged division of labor, plus publish, then filter approach, plus being effective without worrying about being efficient, plus
worse is better, in the sense that many people are willing to make a bad article better than are willing to start from scratch

p122 a predictable imbalance links to "Open Collaboration" paper (Fig 5). Social participation in large-scale systems exhibit a similar pattern described by a power law distribution (frequency of occurrence). Most large social experiments are engines for harnessing inequalities rather than limiting it --> imbalance drives large social systems of interacting elements. 

p212 Small World pattern is descrbied in locally densed clusters inside large-scale social systems 

p266 Success story is composed of plausible promise, an effective tool, and an acceptable bargain with the users.
* promise: *why* for everuone to join, thats basic desire to participate. the promise convinces a potential user to become an actual user. Rather than "Buy OCT", the message should be "Join us , and we will create OCT together"
* tools: there are only good tools for particular jobs, not for any job. Tools must help people do something that actually want to do. There are two basic cosntraints fo group actions, i/ number of people involved, and ii/ duration of interaction, which defide how a tool fits the purpose of the promise
* bargain: it has to be part of the lived experiences of intereaction betwen users. 
* 
## Get real
*Get real, by 37signals*

It contains a list of hints / recipes for success organized in categories for creating web applications / services. Rather than a technical book, the authors focus on short pieces of advice, some of them are quite obvious and make perfect sense at firt glance, but most developers actually fail to get them into their app development process. One learns to focus on the essentials first to get work done. A must-read book together with the rework book.

Go from branstorms to sketches to HTML to codinfg to get something real up and running:
* **Brainstorm**. Come up with ideas. Write a one page story in plain language about what the app needs to do.
* **Design the interface before you start programming**. The interface is your product, what people see is what you are selling. Draw stuff. Paper sketches. 
    * Epicenter desing: start from the core of the page and build outward. Essentials first, extras second. This means you design the most important piece of content first, because a page cannot live without its epicenter (the purpose of the page)
* **Create HTML screens and mock-ups**. Confusion disappears when everyone starts using the same screens. For each screen, you need to consider three possible states: regular, blank, and error. 
    * Regular state is what people see when everything's working fine adn ypur app is flush with data; 
    * Blank state is what people see when using the app for the first time, before data is entered. First impressions are crucial. If you fail to design a thoughtful blank state, you'll create a negative impression of your app; and 
    * Error state is what people see when something goes wrong. Defensive design for the Web.
* **Code it**. When the moock-up looks good, go ahead and plug in the programming code. But remember: keep your code as simple and possible. 

## Rework
*Reword, by 37signals*

This is more a business book than a technical book. It gives short recipes to enhance one's way of working and to thinking in practical and pragmatic terms.

Some remarkable sentences are: 
* Clear writing leads to clear thinking
* Stories, mockups are just approximations. Running software is real.
* Real things lead to real reactions.

## Big Data
*Big Data: A revolution that will transform how we life, work and think, by Viktor Mayer-Schönberger and Kenneth Cukier*

Big Data is about 3 shifts of mindset: 
* Analyse vast amount of data. Instead of using the shortcut of random sample, "Big" is relative to the comprehensive set of data (N=all). Now it si possible because we are in the datafication era: taking information about all things under the sun. 
* Messiness of data instead of exactitude. Impression or messiness may be a positive feature. For example, messiness may refer to combine different types of information from different sources, or it may refer to the inconsistency of formatting. Greater messiness, greater scale. 
* Correlation instead of causality. Knowing what, not why, is good enough. Correlation means non-causal analysis. This goes to data-driven approach versus hypothesis-driven approach (pg 71)

Key points: 
* More data trumps better algorithms
* More data and simpler models trumps less data and complex models
* When location become data (pg 86)
* When interactions become data" (pg 91
* Not a primary use alone, but several, novel uses of data (pg 104)
* What counts is scale in data (pg 146)

## Ted
*Talk like TED, by Carmine Gallo*

The 9 Public-Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds:
* Secret #1: Passion leads to mastery and your presentation is nothing without it. Dig deep to identify your unique and meaningful connection to your presentation. "What makes your heart sing?. Be passionate about your topic. The first step to inspiring others is to make sure you are inspired yourself.
* Secret #2: Tell stories to reach people´s hearts and minds. "Stories are just data with a soul". Stories illustrate, illuminate and inspire.
    * Ethos (credibility), 
    * Logos (evidence, data), 
    * Pathos (emotional appeal)
* Secret #3: Deliver the presentation as comfortably as having a conversation with a close friend. Be natural, speak in a conversational tone, and rehearse, rehearse, and rehearse.
* Secret #4: Reveal information that´s completely new to your audience, packed differently, or offers a fresh and novel way to solve an old problem. Explain your big idea in 140 characters or less. This helps your audience recall the one big idea your´re trying to teach them. "What is the one thing I want my audience to know"
* Secret #5: The jaw-dropping moment is a presentation is when the presenter delivers a shocking, impressive or surprising moment. Does your presentation need a prop? Package statistics in the best, most memorable way. Ending on a high note
* Secret #6: Give your audience something to smile about: Anecdotes, observations and personal stories; Analogies and metaphors; Quotes; Video; Photos
* Secret #7: Stick to the 18-minute rule. Create a message map: 
    * Create a Twitter-friendly headline, 
    * Support the headlines with three key messages, 
    * Reinforce the three messages with stories, statistics, examples
* Secret #8: Paint a mental picture with multisensorial experiences. Use visuals to enhance words, not duplicate. Add images or background pictures to pie charts, tables and graphs. No more than 40 words in the first 10 slides. Kill bullet points on most of your slides. The way to deliver data: one statistic (or theme) per slide, followed by images to give the brain a rest.
* Secret #9: Be authentic, open and transparent. If you try to be something or someone you are not, you´ll fail to gain the trust of your audience. Practice, practice, and practice so that the mechanics of giving your presentation do not monopolize your attention and focus.

Final notes: you need examples, techniques, passion, and practice. You need also courage, the courage to follow your passion, articulate your idea simply, and express what makes your heart sing.

## Quants
*Keeping Up with the Quants: Your Guide to Understanding and Using Analytics, by Thomas Davenport and Jinho Kim*

When using big data to make big decisions, non-quants should focus on the first and the last steps of the process. The numbers people typically handle the details in the middle, but wise non-quants ask lots of questions along the way.

Analytics-based decision making in six steps: 
* Recognize the problem or question: Frame the decision or business problem, and identify possible alternatives to the framing.
* Review previous findings: Identify people who have tried to solve this problem or similar ones—and the approaches they used.
* Model the solution and select the variables: Formulate a detailed hypothesis about how particular variables affect the outcome.
* Collect the data: Gather primary and secondary data on the hypothesized variables.
* Analyse the data: Run a statistical model, assess its appropriateness for the data, and repeat the process until a good fit is found.
* Present and act on the results: Use the data to tell a story to decision makers and stakeholders so that they will take action.

## Future Internet
*The Future of the Internet - And how to Stop it, by Jonathan Zittrain*

Features of a **generative system**: leverage, adaptability, ease of mastery, accessibility, amd transferability. (pg 71)

## Elemento
*El Elemento, by Ken Robinson*

El elemento es el punto de encuentro entre las aptitudes naturales y las inclinaciones personales (pg 39). Las personas hacen lo que les gusta y al hacerlo se sienten realmente ellos mismos: les parece que el tiempo transcurre de manera diferente y se sienten más vivos, más centrados y llenos de vida que en cualquier otro momento. 

El elemento tiene dos características, **capacidad** y **vocación**, y dos condiciones, **actitud** y **oportunidad**, para estar en él. Algo así como: lo entiendo, me encanta, lo quiero, ¿dónde está?

## Fluir
*Fluir, by Mihail Csikszentmihalyi*

La diferencia entre alguien que disfruta la vida y alguien que está abrumado por ella, es producto de la combinación entre factores externos y la manera en que la persona los interpreta, es decir, si ve los desafios como amenazas o como oportunidades para la acción.

Modelo de flujo: 1) Definir las propias metas, no por fuerzas externas; 2) Sentirse inmerso en la actividad; 3) Pretar atención a lo que está sucediendo; 4) Aprender a disfrutar de la experiencia inmediata.

Antes de invertir grandes cantidades de energía en una meta, vale la pena hacerse esta pregunta fundamental: ¿esto es algo que yo realmente quiero hacer? ¿Es algo con lo que disfruto haciéndolo?, ¿Lo disfrutaré probablemente en el futuro? ¿El precio que yo y lo demás tendrán que pagar por ello vale la pena?

Los proyectos auténticos están motivados intrínsicamente, se eligen por lo que valen en sí mismos; los inauténticos están motivados por fuerzas externas.

## Excedente cognitivo
*Excedente Cognitivo: creatividad y generosidad en la era conectada, by Clay Shirky*

La tesis de este autor es afirmar que vivimos una época de excedente en intelecto, energía y tiempo. Gracias a que los nuevos medios de comunicacion han eliminado las barreras de entrada para producir, compartir e intercambiar information, debemos aprovechar estos medios para crear valores públicos y cívicos. La combinación de medios, motivos y oportunidades crean nuestro excedente cognitivo.

Chapter 2: El psicólogo Edward Deci habla de motivaciones intrinsecas y extrínsecas y de una teor'ia que puede explicar un poco más el comportamiento humano, o al menos puede explicar alguna de las cosas que particularmente hago y cual es la motivación que hay detrás de parte de mi trabajo. La teoría de la motivación autodeterminada o [Self determination theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory) (SDT). Uno de los descubrimientos mas sorprendentes es que las personas que son motivadas intrínsecamente, si en el momento de realizar las tareas se les recompensa, por ejemplo, con dinero, dejan de estar interesados por seguir realizándola. Ser amateur, desvinculados de los profesionales por su habilidad, pero cuya motivación es tambien intrínseca. Ser amateur es hacer algo por amor al arte.

Chapter 4: La inovacion impulsada por los usuarios avnazados. Partiendo del hecho que las capacidades de una herramienta no deteminan completamente sus funcionales finales, los usuarios (como grupo) pueden emplear un utensilio de un modo que los diseñadores nunca habrían imaginado. Tambien aqui

Chapter 5: El intercambio en sí es una característica humana, no tecnológica (p.172)

## Wikinomics
*Wikinomics: how mass collaboration changes everything, by Anthony D. Williams*

Las tecnologias que cambian el mundo nada más aparecer son las que son simples e imprevistas, y surgen desde la base y no desde los reconditos despachos de los estrategas empresariales.

## Medici effect
*The Medici Effect, by Frans Johansson*

"By breaking down associative barriers and stepping into the intersection between fields, the number of available idea combinations increases beyond anything we can achieve in a single area. This, then, explains why diverse teams can be more creative than homogeneous groups. It explains why diversifying occupations can increase our output of exceptional ideas. The intersection of fields not only provides the perfect environment for widely different ideas to come together, it also makes it possible for lots of different ideas to do so."
