# Books notes

## Get real
*Get real, by 37signals*

It contains a list of hints / recipes for success organized in categories for creating web applications / services. Rather than a technical book, the authors focus on short pieces of advice, some of them are quite obvious and make perfect sense at firt glance, but most developers actually fail to get them into their app development process. One learns to focus on the essentials first to get work done. A must-read book together with the rework book.

Go from branstorms to sketches to HTML to codinfg to get something real up and running:
* **Brainstorm**. Come up with ideas. Write a one page story in plain language about what the app needs to do.
* **Design the interface before you start programming**. The interface is your product, what people see is what you are selling. Draw stuff. Paper sketches. 
    * Epicenter desing: start from the core of the page and build outward. Essentials first, extras second. This means you design the most important piece of content first, because a page cannot live without its epicenter (the purpose of the page)
* **Create HTML screens and mock-ups**. Confusion disappears when everyone starts using the same screens. For each screen, you need to consider three possible states: regular, blank, and error. 
    * Regular state is what people see when everything's working fine adn ypur app is flush with data; 
    * Blank state is what people see when using the app for the first time, before data is entered. First impressions are crucial. If you fail to design a thoughtful blank state, you'll create a negative impression of your app; and 
    * Error state is what people see when something goes wrong. Defensive design for the Web.
* **Code it**. When the moock-up looks good, go ahead and plug in the programming code. But remember: keep your code as simple and possible. 

## Rework
*Reword, by 37signals*

This is more a business book than a technical book. It gives short recipes to enhance one's way of working and to thinking in practical and pragmatic terms.

Some remarkable sentences are: 
* Clear writing leads to clear thinking
* Stories, mockups are just approximations. Running software is real.
* Real things lead to real reactions.

## Big Data
*Big Data: A revolution that will transform how we life, work and think, by Viktor Mayer-Schönberger and Kenneth Cukier*

Big Data is about 3 shifts of mindset: 
* Analyse vast amount of data. Instead of using the shortcut of random sample, "Big" is relative to the comprehensive set of data (N=all). Now it si possible because we are in the datafication era: taking information about all things under the sun. 
* Messiness of data instead of exactitude. Impression or messiness may be a positive feature. For example, messiness may refer to combine different types of information from different sources, or it may refer to the inconsistency of formatting. Greater messiness, greater scale. 
* Correlation instead of causality. Knowing what, not why, is good enough. Correlation means non-causal analysis. This goes to data-driven approach versus hypothesis-driven approach (pg 71)

Key points: 
* More data trumps better algorithms
* More data and simpler models trumps less data and complex models
* When location become data (pg 86)
* When interactions become data" (pg 91
* Not a primary use alone, but several, novel uses of data (pg 104)
* What counts is scale in data (pg 146)

## Ted
*Talk like TED, by Carmine Gallo*

The 9 Public-Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds:
* Secret #1: Passion leads to mastery and your presentation is nothing without it. Dig deep to identify your unique and meaningful connection to your presentation. "What makes your heart sing?. Be passionate about your topic. The first step to inspiring others is to make sure you are inspired yourself.
* Secret #2: Tell stories to reach people´s hearts and minds. "Stories are just data with a soul". Stories illustrate, illuminate and inspire.
    * Ethos (credibility), 
    * Logos (evidence, data), 
    * Pathos (emotional appeal)
* Secret #3: Deliver the presentation as comfortably as having a conversation with a close friend. Be natural, speak in a conversational tone, and rehearse, rehearse, and rehearse.
* Secret #4: Reveal information that´s completely new to your audience, packed differently, or offers a fresh and novel way to solve an old problem. Explain your big idea in 140 characters or less. This helps your audience recall the one big idea your´re trying to teach them. "What is the one thing I want my audience to know"
* Secret #5: The jaw-dropping moment is a presentation is when the presenter delivers a shocking, impressive or surprising moment. Does your presentation need a prop? Package statistics in the best, most memorable way. Ending on a high note
* Secret #6: Give your audience something to smile about: Anecdotes, observations and personal stories; Analogies and metaphors; Quotes; Video; Photos
* Secret #7: Stick to the 18-minute rule. Create a message map: 
    * Create a Twitter-friendly headline, 
    * Support the headlines with three key messages, 
    * Reinforce the three messages with stories, statistics, examples
* Secret #8: Paint a mental picture with multisensorial experiences. Use visuals to enhance words, not duplicate. Add images or background pictures to pie charts, tables and graphs. No more than 40 words in the first 10 slides. Kill bullet points on most of your slides. The way to deliver data: one statistic (or theme) per slide, followed by images to give the brain a rest.
* Secret #9: Be authentic, open and transparent. If you try to be something or someone you are not, you´ll fail to gain the trust of your audience. Practice, practice, and practice so that the mechanics of giving your presentation do not monopolize your attention and focus.

Final notes: you need examples, techniques, passion, and practice. You need also courage, the courage to follow your passion, articulate your idea simply, and express what makes your heart sing.

## Quants
*Keeping Up with the Quants: Your Guide to Understanding and Using Analytics, by Thomas Davenport and Jinho Kim*

When using big data to make big decisions, non-quants should focus on the first and the last steps of the process. The numbers people typically handle the details in the middle, but wise non-quants ask lots of questions along the way.

Analytics-based decision making in six steps: 
* Recognize the problem or question: Frame the decision or business problem, and identify possible alternatives to the framing.
* Review previous findings: Identify people who have tried to solve this problem or similar ones—and the approaches they used.
* Model the solution and select the variables: Formulate a detailed hypothesis about how particular variables affect the outcome.
* Collect the data: Gather primary and secondary data on the hypothesized variables.
* Analyse the data: Run a statistical model, assess its appropriateness for the data, and repeat the process until a good fit is found.
* Present and act on the results: Use the data to tell a story to decision makers and stakeholders so that they will take action.
