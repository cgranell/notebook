# SOA - What is it?
**Service-oriented** means all is about services

**Architecture** means guidelines, styles, way of doing things

* Video: [What's middleware? Service oriented architecture explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s_S5Hkm7z0). John explained us that the transit pass is indeed a `public service interface` for customers
* Video (optional): [SOA Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suf5FbTT7T8). More formal explanation from a university professor.

# SOA - Characteristics 
Services are `building blocks` that expose the following characteristics:
* abstraction, 
* encapsulation, 
* reuse, 
* flexibility, 
* decoupling...

* Baroque vs. Romanic art (guidelines)
* [San Martin de Tours Church, Fromista](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mart%C3%ADn_de_Tours_Church,_Fr%C3%B3mista) vs. [Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela](http://www.catedraldesantiago.es/) (implementation of such guidelines)

# Web Services - Characteristics
Like Html5, Web services refer actually to a set of specifications called [Web Services protocol stack](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-arch-20021114/#extended)

* Description: [WSDL](https://www.google.es/webhp?q=:inurl:+%3Fwsdl)
* Transport: SOAP
* Discovery: UDDI
* and many others ...: ...

# SOC - What is it?

 SOC uses `services` as the basic constructs to support the development of rapid, low-cost and easy `composition` of distributed applications [Papazoglou et al, 2013](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=A584B4950C4A2C15F2428E1E10475057?doi=10.1.1.76.3917&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

# SOC - Patterns

* Compose
* Execute
* Manage
* Monitor
*  ... (+ semantics)

# SOC - Discussion

* Did **final users** benefit in using/exploiting services?
* Did **developers gain** in devleopn applications?
* Did **industry** benefit?
* Who actually benefited from the irruption of SOA, SOC, etc?

# Application Programing Interfaces (APIs)
[APIs](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) for client-side applications to access web services: mashups applications , portals, etc. You all know from the visualization course... 

Mashup examples: Craiglist, Housingmaps, [Usahidi](http://geospatialrevolution.psu.edu/episode1/chapter4), etc.
