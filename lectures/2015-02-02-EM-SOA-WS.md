# SOA - What is it?
**Service-oriented** means all is about services

**Architecture** means guidelines, styles, way of doing things

* Video: [What's middleware? Service oriented architecture explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s_S5Hkm7z0). John explained us that the transit pass is indeed a `public service interface` for customers
* Video (optional): [SOA Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suf5FbTT7T8). More formal explanation from a university professor.

# SOA - Characteristics 
Services are `building blocks` that expose the following characteristics:
* abstraction, 
* encapsulation, 
* reuse, 
* flexibility, 
* decoupling...

# SOA - Discussion

* Baroque vs. Romanic art (guidelines)
* [San Martin de Tours Church, Fromista](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mart%C3%ADn_de_Tours_Church,_Fr%C3%B3mista) vs. [Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela](http://www.catedraldesantiago.es/) (implementation of such guidelines)

# SOA/SOC - Patterns

 Service-oriented Computing (SOC) uses `services` as the basic constructs to support the development of rapid, low-cost and easy creation of distributed applications [Papazoglou et al, 2013](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=A584B4950C4A2C15F2428E1E10475057?doi=10.1.1.76.3917&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

# SOA/SOC - Patterns

Web services can then be:
* Described
* Registered
* Discovered
* Composed
* Executed
* Managed 
* Monitoried
*  ... (+ enriched/annotated with semantics)

# Web services - What is it?
* Video: [Web Services tutorial: What is a web service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u80uPzhFYvc), by lynda.com.

# Web Services - Characteristics
Like Html5, the term web services refer(ed) actually to a set of specifications that altogether were called [Web Services protocol stack](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-arch-20021114/#extended)

* Description: [WSDL](https://www.google.es/webhp?q=:inurl:+%3Fwsdl)
* Transport: SOAP
* Discovery: UDDI
* and many others ...: ...

# Web Services - Discussion

* Did **final users** benefit from using/exploiting SOA and web services?
* Did **developers** implement easily and quicker sapplications?
* Did **industry** benefit from selling SOA solutions?
* Who actually benefited from the irruption of SOA, SOC, etc?

# REST

Representational **State** Transfer

---
class: middle
# REST
REST originally appeared as one chapter in [Roy Fielding's PhD](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)

Basic ideas: 
* Leverage HTTP as application protocol 
* Even though HTTP is statelss, but REST enables stateful connections over HTTP because state is embedded in the very HTTP messagge:
    * HTTP method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
    * Error code: 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
    * Mime types: txt, png, csv, etc.       
* Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State. It means that hypertext should be used (by clients) to find your way through the API.

# REST

```xml
GET /account/12345 HTTP/1.1 

HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
<account> 
    <account_number>12345</account_number> 
    <balance currency="usd">100.00</balance> 
    <link rel="deposit" href="/account/12345/deposit" /> 
    <link rel="withdraw" href="/account/12345/withdraw" /> 
    <link rel="transfer" href="/account/12345/transfer" /> 
    <link rel="close" href="/account/12345/close" /> 
</account>
```

# Restful services

Restful services adopt the REST principles to:
* expose resources as services accesible using HTTP, 
* use standards mime types, and open formats (e.g XML, JSON)

As a result:
* Restful services imposed over SOAP web services
* [APIs](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) for client-side applications quickly proliferated to access restful web services. 
    * Big players (Amazon, google, Esri, ...) changed to support restful APIs
    * Open Data, Cloud platforms, IoT, Sensors, weareables, ... 
* Hundreds of mashups applications: Craiglist, Housingmaps, [Usahidi](http://geospatialrevolution.psu.edu/episode1/chapter4), etc.

# Restful services - Discussion

* Did **final users** benefit from using/exploiting resftul services?
* Did **developers** implement easily and quicker applications?
* Did **industry** benefit from adopting restful APIs?
* Who actually benefited from the irruption of restful services?

# Summary
* SOA and the concept of services as abstraction remain valid
* Long life restful services! No discussion any more
* Simplicity versus artificial complexity
* Basic standards versus many (volatile) specifications
