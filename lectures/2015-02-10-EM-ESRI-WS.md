# Motivating examples - Summary
* Books: [Get Real](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/), [Rework](http://37signals.com/rework/), [Lean Start-up](http://theleanstartup.com/book),...
    * Come up with an idea. Make something **you** want to use/solve. 
    * Short cycles and small decisions because meetings are toxic and plans are guess (but software is real).  
    * The interface is your product. What people see is what you are selling. Draw stuff before programming. Paper sketches. HTML mockups
    * Less features. Essential first, extras second. Simple code
    * Get something real up and running. Launch quick and get real feedback asap

# ArcGIS REST API (server-side)

# Types of ESRI REST services and resources
[Hierarchy of resources and operations](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Resources_and_operations/02r3000000t9000000/):
* Service discovery (Catalog Resource)
* Map service
* Feature service
* Image service
* Geometry service
* Geocode service
* Geoprocessing service
* and other types of services 

---
class: middle
# Types of ESRI REST services - Service discovery

* = `catalog resource`
* Entry point to folders and services published in an ArcGIS server host
    * Root/permanent URL: http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/
* Browse and get service-level metadata
* Use it to know services' properties and allowed operations, and to test service.

# Types of ESRI REST services - Map service

* [Map Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Map_Service/02r3000000w2000000/): 
    * Makes maps, features and atribute data public; Shares ArcMap map documents 
    * End users get access to a set of map-related resources (map service, layers, tables, map tiles. etc); 
* Service capabilities selected leads to supported operations/functionality: 
    - `Mapping`  (always enabled): access to a map
    - `KML`: access to KML features
    - `Feature Access`: access/edition to feature layers in the map
    - `WMS`, `WCS`, `WFS`: Compliance with OGC specificatons ((and WMTS for cached map)
* E.g.: [Smart Campus Building MapServer](http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/SmartCampus/BuildingsNew/MapServer)

# Types of ESRI REST services - Feature service

* [Feature Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Feature_Service/02r3000000z2000000/): 
    * Serves features and symbology to render them at client side
    * End users execute queries to get features and perform edits
* It is a Map Service but with `Feature Access` capability enabled
* E.g.: [Smart Ways FeatureServer](http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/SmartWays/SmartWaysParking/FeatureServer)

# Types of ESRI REST services - Image service

* [Image Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Image_Service/02r3000000q8000000/):
    * Access to raster and image data; 
    * End users can visualize and/or analyse shared rasters
* Service capabilities selected leads to supported operations/functionality: 
    - `Imaging` (always enabled): allows images (mosaic datasets) to be displayed
    - `WMS`, `WCS`: compliance with OGC specifications (and WMTS for cached image)

# Types of ESRI REST services - Geometry service

* [Geometry Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Geometry_Service/02r3000000qs000000/): 
    * Provides access to common geometric operations (area, buffer, distance, convex hull, etc).
* E.g.: [Smart Campus GeometryServer](http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/Utilities/Geometry/GeometryServer)

---
class: middle
# Types of ESRI REST services - Geocode service

* [Geocode Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Geocode_Service/02r3000000q9000000/): 
    * geocoding: address/placename to location, 
    * reverse-geocoding: locations to address/placename.

# Types of ESRI REST services - GeoProcessing service

* [GP Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/GP_Service/02r3000000rq000000/): 
    * Access to tools and processes (from toolbox or user-defined).
    * Syncronous / asyncronous execution.
* Service capabilities selected leads to supported operations/functionality: 
    * `WPS`: compliance with OGC specifications

* E.g.: [PERCEPTION GPServer](http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/PERCEPTION/snapPointToNetworkFloorAsync/GPServer)

# Types of ESRI REST services - Others

* [Geodata Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/GeoData_Service/02r3000000vs000000/):  access to geodatabases
* [Globe Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Globe_Service/02r3000000ww000000/): access to 3D content
* [GeoEvent Service](http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/linux/overview-of-geoevent-services.htm): real-time filtering and processing of geo-referenced events
* [Stream Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Stream_Services/02r300000288000000/): real-time data dissemination for client and server data flow
* and others...
