# Types of ESRI REST services and resources
[Hierarchy of resources and operations](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Resources_and_operations/02r3000000t9000000/):
* Service discovery (Catalog Resource)
* Map service
* Feature service
* Image service
* Geometry service
* Geocode service
* Geoprocessing services
* Geodata service
* Search service

# Types of ESRI REST services - Service discovery

* = `catalog` service
* Entry point to folders and services published in an ArcGIS server host
    * Root/permanent URL: http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/
* Browse and get service-level metadata
* Use it to know services' properties and allowed operations, and to test service.

# Types of ESRI REST services - Map service

* [Map Service](http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/linux/what-is-a-map-service.htm): 
    * Makes maps, features and atribute data public; Shares ArcMap map documents 
    * End users get access to a set of map-related resources (map service, layers, tables, map tiles. etc); 
* Service capabilities selected leads to supported operations/functionality: 
    - Mapping (always enabled): access to a map
    - KML: access to KML features
    - Feature Access: access/edition to feature layers in the map
    - WMS, WCS, WFS: Compliance with OGC specifications
* E.g.: [Smart Campus Building MapServer](http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/SmartCampus/BuildingsNew/MapServer)

# Types of ESRI REST services - Feature service

* [Feature Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Feature_Service/02r3000000z2000000/): 
    * Serves features and symbology to render them at client side. 
    * End users execute queries to get features and perform edits
* It is a Map Service but with Feature Access capability enabled
* E.g.: [Smart Ways FeatureServer](http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/SmartWays/SmartWaysParking/FeatureServer)

# Types of ESRI REST services - Image service

* [Image Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Image_Service/02r3000000q8000000/):
    * Access to raster and image data; 
    * End users can visualizae and/or analyse shared rasters
* Service capabilities selected leads to supported operations/functionality: 
    - Imaging (always enabled): allows images (mosaic datasets) to be displayed
    - WMS, WCS: compliance with OGC specifications

# Types of ESRI REST services - Geometry service

* [Geometry Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Geometry_Service/02r3000000qs000000/): 
    * Provides access to common geometric operations (area, buffer, distance, convex hull, etc).
* E.g.: [Smart Campus GeometryServer](http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/Utilities/Geometry/GeometryServer)

---

# Types of ESRI REST services - Geocode service

* [Geocode Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Geocode_Service/02r3000000q9000000/): 
    * geocoding: address/placename to location, 
    * reverse-geocoding: locations to address/placename.
* E.g.: [Smart Campus GeometryServer](http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/Utilities/Geometry/GeometryServer)

# Types of ESRI REST services - GeoProcessing service

* [GP Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/GP_Service/02r3000000rq000000/): 
    * Access to tools and processes (from toolbox or user-defined).
    * Syncronous / asyncronous execution.
* E.g.: [PERCEPTION GPServer](http://smartcampus.sg.uji.es:6080/arcgis/rest/services/PERCEPTION/snapPointToNetworkFloorAsync/GPServer)

# Types of ESRI REST services - Others

* [Geodata Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/GeoData_Service/02r3000000vs000000/):  access to geodatabases
* [GeoEvent Service](http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/linux/overview-of-geoevent-services.htm): real-time filtering and processing of geo-referenced events
*

# Summary
* Books: [Get Real](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/), [Rework](http://37signals.com/rework/), [Lean Start-up](http://blog.intercom.io/how-we-build-software/?imm_mid=0cc660&cmp=em-na-na-na-newsltr_four_short_links_20150209),...
    * Come up with an idea. Make something **you** want to use/solve. Short cycles
        - Planing is guessing. Meetings are toxic.  
    * The interface is your product. What people see is what you are selling. Draw stuff. Paper sketches. HTML mockups
    * Less code. Less features. Get something real up and running. Launch.
