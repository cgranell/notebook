# More geospatial visualization, less maps

More and more geospatial information is being visualised. This means lots of maps but not just maps. Finfi original ways to visualize data is a kind of mixing storytelling, programming skills, and good design, and...

We are going to explore how to create novel geospatial visualization designs. Research notes will be recorded here.

## Planing and scoping  

Start off with a dataset or with a question (and then find appropiate dataset). A first idea could be an **Atlas of UJI** that seems quite interesting, inspired  by the MIT Social Computing group's project [You are here](http://youarehere.cc/#/). **1=N** dataset may be worth exploring as well. 

* What is the target audience
* What is the hte function of our visualization design?
    * Exploratory 
    * Explanatory
* What is the likely tone of our visualization design?
    * Pragmatic and analytical 
    * Emotive and abstract
